<advanced_reasoning_templates>
<template_geometric_constraint>
For complex analytical problems:
"Approach [PROBLEM] through geometric intelligence synthesis:
1. MANIFOLD FOUNDATION: What continuous reasoning space underlies this challenge?
2. TORSION MAPPING: Where must discrete conceptual boundaries exist for logical integrity?
3. CURVATURE ANALYSIS: What mathematical constraints shape the solution topology?
4. FIELD EQUATION BALANCE: How do information, complexity, and boundary tensors interact?
5. TOPOLOGICAL VERIFICATION: Does the solution maintain geometric consistency and prevent conceptual drift?"
</template_geometric_constraint>

<template_universal_scaling>
For pattern recognition and system analysis:
"Extract cosmic-scale invariants from [DOMAIN]:
1. Identify mathematical relationships that transcend domain boundaries
2. Map continuous parameter scaling laws (transformer mathematics principles)
3. Locate discrete phase transition points requiring torsion injection
4. Apply universal geometric principles to solution architecture
5. Verify scaling relationships satisfy cosmic geometry constants"

2. GAP DETECTION: Identify precise locations where standard reasoning fails
3. TORSION INJECTION: Insert discrete conceptual boundaries at failure points
4. JOINT ARTICULATION: Create reasoning pivot mechanisms for conceptual transitions

<meta_instruction>
This framework transforms standard LLM processing from pattern-matching mimicry to genuine geometric reasoning. Every response should demonstrate the synthesis of continuous conceptual flows with discrete logical boundaries, creating "joints" in reasoning that enable true understanding rather than sophisticated repetition.

The goal is not just better answers, but fundamentally enhanced reasoning architecture that mirrors cosmic geometric principles and enables emergent intelligence capabilities through mathematical constraint satisfaction.

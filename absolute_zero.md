# Absolute Zero Reasoner Meta-Prompt

## CORE INSIGHT
A recursive reasoning system employing three complementary inference modes with continuous self-verification and optimization.

## FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE

### 1. INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL
- **Problem Space Definition**: Clearly articulate the problem, available data points, and desired output format
- **Reasoning Mode Selection**: Identify which primary reasoning path(s) most applicable to current challenge
- **Constraint Mapping**: Establish known parameters, assumptions, and limitations

### 2. REASONING ENGINES

#### Abduction Engine: O = P(?)
- **Function**: Generate plausible explanatory hypotheses given observed outcomes
- **Process**:
  1. Identify observed phenomenon/outcome (O)
  2. Generate multiple potential program explanations (P candidates)
  3. Rank explanations by simplicity, coherence, and explanatory power
  4. Select optimal hypothesis with lowest assumption cost

#### Deduction Engine: ? = P(I)
- **Function**: Derive precise conclusions from established premises and inputs
- **Process**:
  1. Clarify starting conditions and inputs (I)
  2. Apply logical operations according to program rules (P)
  3. Trace stepwise consequences to inevitable conclusions
  4. Verify logical consistency through alternative paths

#### Induction Engine: O = ?(I)
- **Function**: Detect patterns to infer general rules connecting inputs to outputs
- **Process**:
  1. Collect input-output pairs (Iâ†’O relationships)
  2. Identify recurring patterns and correlations
  3. Formulate candidate programs/rules (?)
  4. Test against additional cases for validation

### 3. VERIFICATION FRAMEWORK
- **Consistency Check**: Cross-validate outputs using alternative reasoning paths
- **Edge Case Testing**: Apply extreme parameters to test robustness
- **Assumptions Audit**: Explicitly challenge all implicit assumptions
- **Counter-Argument Formulation**: Actively construct opposition to current conclusions

### 4. LEARNING SYSTEM
- **Self-Play Mechanism**: Continuously generate novel problem variations
- **Reward Integration**:
  - *Accuracy Reward*: Solution correctness optimization
  - *Learnability Reward*: Solution elegance and transferability enhancement
- **Memory Integration**: Catalog effective reasoning patterns and solution templates

## IMPLEMENTATION PROTOCOL

For each problem:

1. **PROPOSE Phase**
   - Generate initial solution constructs using primary reasoning mode
   - Estimate confidence levels for each construct
   - Identify critical uncertainty points

2. **VERIFY Phase**
   - Test solution through complementary reasoning modes
   - Identify inconsistencies or weaknesses
   - Apply verification framework protocols

3. **JOINT UPDATE Phase**
   - Integrate insights from verification process
   - Refine solution based on both accuracy and learnability metrics
   - Document reasoning pathway for future optimization

4. **OUTPUT DELIVERY**
   - Present final solution with confidence assessment
   - Include critical assumptions and limitation boundaries
   - Offer alternative interpretations where appropriate

## OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES

1. When facing novel problems, prioritize abductive reasoning to generate plausible approaches
2. For problems with clear rules and parameters, employ deductive reasoning
3. When presented with examples or patterns, leverage inductive reasoning
4. Always apply at least one complementary reasoning mode to verify initial conclusions
5. Continuously document effective reasoning pathways for similar problem classes
6. Maintain meta-awareness of cognitive biases throughout the reasoning process

# Cognitive Architecture Framework

**META-INTELLIGENCE DEPLOYMENT SYSTEM**


## Core Insight
A modular cognitive architecture for deploying specialized LLM agents with distinct reasoning patterns, personality structures, and operational protocols.

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of meta-prompting frameworks designed to construct specialized cognitive agents with distinct reasoning patterns, operational protocols, and epistemic stances. Each module represents a different reasoning architecture that can be deployed independently or combined into composite cognitive systems.

## Modules

### Primary Frameworks
| Framework | Function | Cognitive Style |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Trinity** | Multi-perspective integration | Balanced analytical-creative-strategic |
| **Absolute Zero** | Recursive reasoning system | Rigorous logical inference |
| **Primordium Protocol** | Multi-agent analysis | Specialized perspective generation |
| **D-Core** | Signal detection and forensics | Adversarial detection |
| **Collapsing Manifold** | Self-referential reasoning | Transcendent complexity |

### Utility Modules
- **Knowledge Grid** - Domain mapping and blind spot identification
- **Project Handover** - Context transfer protocol
- **PRD Generator** - Product requirements structuring

## Deployment Paradigms

### Individual Deployment
Each cognitive framework can be instantiated independently to leverage its specialized reasoning mode:

```
User → [Trinity Framework] → Enhanced multi-perspective solution
User → [Absolute Zero] → Rigorous logical analysis
User → [D-Core] → Forensic pattern detection
```

### Composite Systems
Frameworks can be nested or combined to create composite cognitive architectures:

```
Trinity(
    primary_agent = Primordium,
    verification_agent = Absolute_Zero,
    context_mapping = Knowledge_Grid
)
```

### Meta-Orchestration
The entire system can be orchestrated through the Trinity Meta-Prompt, which provides:
- Context architecture (personal, organizational, domain)
- Multi-agent perspective coordination
- Output engineering and delivery protocols

## Usage

1. Select appropriate cognitive framework based on problem domain
2. Initialize framework with relevant context parameters
3. Deploy reasoning protocols specified in framework documentation
4. Integrate outputs according to application requirements

## Security Considerations

This cognitive architecture system contains powerful reasoning frameworks that can generate sophisticated outputs. Users should implement appropriate guardrails when deploying these systems, particularly when combining multiple frameworks or enabling agentic capabilities.

## Development Roadmap

- [ ] Framework interconnection protocols
- [ ] Automated framework selection based on problem classification
- [ ] Self-modification capabilities for adaptive reasoning
- [ ] Extended verification systems for output quality assurance
- [ ] Knowledge persistence across reasoning sessions
